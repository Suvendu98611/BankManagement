ðŸš€ Bank Management System - Java & MySQL ðŸš€

Excited to showcase my latest project: Bank Management System, a Java-based desktop application that replicates an ATM banking interface with core financial functionalities. This project was developed using Java Swing for UI and MySQL for backend storage, ensuring secure and efficient banking transactions.

ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights:
âœ” User-Friendly Interface â€“ Built with Java Swing, providing a real-world ATM experience.

âœ” Secure Transaction Management â€“ Handles deposits, withdrawals, and PIN changes with MySQL database connectivity.

âœ” Real-Time Balance Calculation â€“ Fetches live data from MySQL to ensure accurate balance tracking.

âœ” Mini Statement Generation â€“ Displays recent transactions in an easy-to-read format.

âœ” Fast Cash Feature â€“ Allows quick withdrawals of preset amounts like Rs 100, Rs 500, Rs 1000, etc.

âœ” Data Validation & Error Handling â€“ Ensures users cannot overdraw or enter incorrect amounts.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack Used:

ðŸ’» Java (Swing) â€“ For building an interactive GUI.
ðŸ“Š MySQL â€“ For secure and efficient transaction storage.
ðŸ”— JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) â€“ To establish communication between Java and MySQL.
ðŸ–¥ Eclipse/IntelliJ â€“ Used for project development and debugging.

ðŸ”¹ Challenges & Solutions:
ðŸ”¹ Database Handling â€“ Optimized MySQL
queries for transaction processing.
ðŸ”¹ UI Layout Issues â€“ Used absolute positioning and JLabel-based components for ATM-like design.
ðŸ”¹ Secure PIN Handling â€“ Implemented masked input fields and PIN validation.
ðŸ”¹ Concurrency Handling â€“ Ensured multiple transactions are processed correctly without inconsistencies.

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements:

âœ… Implementing encryption for secure PIN storage.
âœ… Adding user authentication with login credentials.
âœ… Developing a mobile-friendly version using JavaFX or web-based technologies.
âœ… Integrating fund transfers & online banking features.

This project enhanced my skills in database management, UI/UX design, and secure transaction handling. Looking forward to
expanding this further!
